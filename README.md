# The Koech Global Impact Foundation

**Empowering Youth through Education, Sports & Business**

## Our Vision

We envision a world in which empowered young people lead and build thriving communities — where education, athletic talent, and entrepreneurial spirit combine to unlock full potential.
We believe: **“Education + Talent Takes Us Far.”**

## Our Mission

The Koech Global Impact Foundation exists to:

* Give youth access to high-quality education and mentorship → building knowledge, skills and confidence.
* Support young athletes in running and track & field to achieve excellence on the world stage, while developing character, discipline and global identity (drawing on our deep Kenyan roots).
* Foster entrepreneurship and business development in youth, especially in underserved communities, to create pathways for economic self-sufficiency and leadership.
* Integrate our efforts so that education, sport and business reinforce one another — producing well-rounded young adults who use their talent for impact.

## Our Core Values

* **Excellence & Discipline** – aiming for the highest standards in academics, athletics and enterprise.
* **Legacy & Heritage** – honouring our Kenyan identity and the spirit of the Koech family’s legacy in sport, community and leadership.
* **Equity & Opportunity** – ensuring that youth from all backgrounds have access to mentoring, resources and support in education, sport and business.
* **Leadership & Service** – nurturing leadership skills and a commitment to giving back, so beneficiaries become future change-makers.
* **Holistic Development** – treating each young person as a full human being: mind, body, spirit, talent and purpose.

## What We Do

1. **Educational Programs & Scholarships**

   * Provide scholarships, tutoring, mentoring for students in Kenya and the diaspora.
   * Host workshops on digital skills (leveraging Basil’s CS background), critical thinking, career planning, and global exposure.
   * Support after-school learning hubs, library access, and resource centres in underserved areas.

2. **Sports & Athletic Development**

   * Support promising middle- and long-distance runners (e.g., 3,000 m, 5,000 m) with coaching, training camps, equipment and competition entry.
   * Run youth clinics emphasising not only performance but character, teamwork, international exposure and Kenyan identity.
   * Build an athlete agency that helps talent transition into opportunities, scholarships or professional levels.

3. **Entrepreneurship & Business Incubation**

   * Offer micro-grants, seed funding, workshops on business fundamentals, digital literacy, marketing, and finance.
   * Encourage youth to launch small enterprises, social ventures or tech start-ups — especially combining sport or education with business models.
   * Facilitate networking, mentorship, and internships (including in tech/chip-making industry, aligning with Basil’s interest in Micron and semiconductors).

4. **Community Engagement & Global Partnerships**

   * Host outreach events in Kenya and the US, linking diaspora youth with Kenyan youth for mentorship and cross-cultural exchange.
   * Partner with schools, universities (including Chicago State University where Basil is affiliated), sports clubs, NGOs and businesses.
   * Monitor and evaluate impact: tracking student outcomes, athlete performance, business start-ups launched, community indicators.

## Why We’re Unique

* Founded and led by Basil Koech, a Kenyan-American, CS student, athlete and leader — blending tech, sport, education and entrepreneurship in one vision.
* Rooted in the Kenyan identity and diaspora experience — giving beneficiaries a global mindset and local relevance.
